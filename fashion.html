I don’t know about you, but I go through stages of colours in my life and I just get obsessed with them. For example, when rose gold became a trend, I instantly fell in love. It all started with a rose gold I phone then everything had to be rose gold. My kitchen even looked like a rose gold glitter party. Mint has always been one of my favourites, I even created a kitchen theme with these colours in the past. There’s just something about the colour mint that is so fresh, and it just gives you an energetic and calming feeling. Its a colour that fits in with all seasons. Chocolate and mint is also a lovely combination, as well as eaten.
I completed research into the love affair with the colour mint green. “So, what is it about mint green? For many, a light green hue evokes feelings of freshness and coolness. Designers seem to be quite fond of using it in contrast to a flat grey in their latest creations. The colour was, of course, first inspired by nature, with which so many of us have lost touch. Mint green, or a muted/pastel shade, is said to represent tranquillity to many people and has a calming effect. Perhaps this is why it’s often used in hospitals.”
